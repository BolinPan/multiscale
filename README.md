# Multiscale

This repository will collect codes accompanying the publication:
A. Hauptmann, J. Adler, S. R. Arridge and O. Oktem, "Multi-Scale Learned Iterative Reconstruction," 
in IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging, doi: https://doi.org/10.1109/TCI.2020.2990299

Scripts will need Python with PyTorch, ODL and ASTRA toolbox

Note: We can only upload codes without the training data due to size restrictions. 
Reference to data sources will be made in the respective folder.
